# Customer Analytics and Predictive Modeling Repository  

This repository contains three machine learning projects focused on customer behavior analysis, sales forecasting, and churn prediction. Each project demonstrates the application of statistical and machine learning techniques to solve real-world business problems.  

## Projects  

### 1. **Customer Behavior Analysis with Linear Regression**  
This project leverages linear regression to model and analyze customer behavior patterns. It examines key factors influencing customer decisions and quantifies their impact on business outcomes.  

### 2. **Sales Prediction and Analysis with Linear Regression**  
A predictive analytics project that applies linear regression to forecast sales performance. The model identifies significant drivers of sales and provides actionable insights for business strategy.  

### 3. **Telco Customer Churn Prediction using Random Forest**  
A classification project that predicts customer churn in the telecommunications sector using a Random Forest algorithm. The model helps identify at-risk customers, enabling proactive retention strategies.  

## Project Structure  
Each project includes:  
- **Detailed README**: Methodology, dataset description, and key findings.  
- **Code Implementation**: Scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.  
- **Results**: Visualizations and performance metrics.
